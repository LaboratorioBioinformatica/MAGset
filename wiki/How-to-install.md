<h1>Requirements</h1>

* Docker (see https://docs.docker.com/install/ if it is not already installed in your system)
* Linux system operation (we validated MAGset with ubuntu 16/18/20 and CentOS 7, but if you can run docker, MAGset is expected to work too).
* About 12GB of free space (mostly for docker images)

<h1>Installing </h1>

* Download the main script <br/>
`curl -OL https://github.com/LaboratorioBioinformatica/magset/releases/download/1.2.0/run-magset.sh`
<br/> or <br/>
`wget https://github.com/LaboratorioBioinformatica/magset/releases/download/1.2.0/run-magset.sh`
* Make the script executable <br/>
`chmod +x run-magset.sh`

That's it! Please test your installation following the [Quick start](Quick-start.md) tutorial.
